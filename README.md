# scientific-paper-summarization

## Usage

To run the summarization code, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can execute the `summarization.ipynb` notebooks in a Jupyter environment to see the summarization process in action.
